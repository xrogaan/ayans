+## Creating pages
+
+You have already some files in the pages/ subdirectory. You can look
+them to get a big idea of how this system works. You'll needs to read
+and learn the [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup
+language.
+
+### Design of the pages.mdtxt files
+
+There are two part in this files : a header and the page content.
+
+The header is encapsulated into two set of three dash (---). Each
+line contain a variable used by the system. Actually, only two are
+used :
+
+* title : to set the page title
+* layout : to define the template to use
+
+The layout variable refer to the first part of the template filename.
+If the template filename is "index.tpl.php" then, the layout needs to
+be set to "index". It is recommended to write the values surrounded
+in quotes.
+
+#### Sample
+
+---
+title = "sample"
+layout = "sample"
+---
+I'm a sample. Dummy text for everyones.
+
+Blah blah blah
